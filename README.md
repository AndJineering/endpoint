 * Running Tests

The tests use `pytest`

To use a virtual environment for this, do the following:
`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate` # Unix based OS
`venv\Scripts\activate` # Windows
`pip -r requirements.txt`

Now `pytest` is installed.

Run the tests with `pytest test_directories.py`

When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment with
`deactivate`
